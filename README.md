## Cat-vs-Dog-classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using Python and TensorFlow. The dataset is organized into cat/ and dog/ subfolders under a training directory, and the model is trained, evaluated, and used for predictions inside a Jupyter Notebook.
